Why Splunk Was Invented?

Before Splunk (early 2000s), IT teams had a huge problem:

Every server, application, network device, and security tool produced logs (machine data).

These logs were often unstructured (different formats, plain text, no order).

To troubleshoot an issue, engineers had to manually open log files, search with grep/find, and hope they spotted the error.

In large companies with hundreds of servers, this became nearly impossible.

ðŸ’¡ So in 2003, three engineers (Michael Baum, Rob Das, Erik Swan) built Splunk to act like Google for logs:

Collect machine data from many sources.

Index it (like a search engine).

Let you run fast searches in real-time.

By 2005, Splunk became popular because it made IT operations and security analysis much faster. Today itâ€™s a leader in SIEM (Security Information & Event Management).

ðŸ”¹ How Splunk Works (Simple View)

Think of Splunk in 3 steps:

Data Ingestion

Logs, events, metrics from servers, firewalls, applications, IoT devices, etc.

Example: Apache access logs, Windows Event Logs, Linux syslogs.

Indexing

Splunk stores this data in special buckets (hot, warm, cold).

Each event gets a timestamp and metadata (host, source, sourcetype).

Searching & Visualization

You use SPL (Search Processing Language) to query data.

Results can be shown as tables, charts, dashboards, or alerts.

Splunk Architecture (Core Components)

1.Forwarder: Small agent installed on source machines to send data to Splunk.

2.Indexer: Stores and indexes the data (the brain).

3.Search Head: Provides the UI where you search, make dashboards, and run reports.

ðŸ‘‰ In small setups, one machine can be all three. In enterprises, they are distributed.
